# **HASS Trading System v1.0** 🚀

## **Overview** 📊
The HASS Trading System is an advanced, multi-agent platform designed to optimize options trading strategies by leveraging cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, real-time data analysis, and adaptive risk management. The system integrates bias-aware sentiment analysis, graph-based pattern recognition, and insider trading monitoring to make informed, profitable decisions.

---

## **Key Features** 🌟

### **1. Multi-Agent Architecture** 🤖
The system comprises specialized agents for modular, scalable operation:
- **Media Analysis Agent** 📰: Analyzes real-time news and sentiment with bias detection.
- **Market Data Agent** 📈: Aggregates and processes real-time financial data.
- **Pattern Recognition Agent** 🔍: Identifies trends, relationships, and anomalies in data.
- **Risk Management Agent** ⚖️: Dynamically adjusts trading strategies based on risk factors.
- **Execution Agent** 💹: Ensures timely and efficient trade execution.

### **2. Advanced Analytics** 📡
- **Sentiment Analysis** 💭: Extracts public sentiment and adjusts for media biases.
- **Pattern Recognition** 📊: Discovers deep connections and recurring trading patterns.
- **Backtesting and Optimization** 🧪: Validates strategies using historical data.

### **3. Real-Time Integration** 🌐
- Leverages APIs like **Polygon.io**, **Yahoo Finance**, **Google News**, and **OpenSecrets.org**.
- Supports streaming data ingestion and event-driven communication using **Kafka** and **gRPC**.

### **4. Risk Management** 🛡️
- Tracks insider trades and political donations to assess potential conflicts.
- Implements dynamic position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms.

## **System Enhancements** 🚀

### **1. Bias-Aware Sentiment Analysis** 📰
**Objective**: Analyze media sentiment with adjustments for ownership and bias.
- Cross-references sentiment scores with media ownership data.
- Adjusts for political leaning to provide unbiased insights.

**Example**:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
import pandas as pd

ownership_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Media Outlet": ["Outlet A", "Outlet B"],
    "Parent Company": ["Company X", "Company Y"],
    "Political Leaning": ["Conservative", "Liberal"]
})

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

def adjust_for_bias(news, outlet):
    sentiment = sentiment_pipeline(news)[0]['label']
    bias = ownership_data[ownership_data["Media Outlet"] == outlet]["Political Leaning"].values[0]
    if bias == "Conservative" and sentiment == "POSITIVE":
        return "BIASED_POSITIVE"
    elif bias == "Liberal" and sentiment == "NEGATIVE":
        return "BIASED_NEGATIVE"
    return sentiment
```

---

### **2. Graph-Based Corporate Connections** 🔗
**Objective**: Map multi-layered corporate and personal connections up to 6 degrees.
- Uses Neo4j to analyze relationships and detect anomalies.

**Example**:
```python
from py2neo import Graph, Node, Relationship

graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

company_a = Node("Company", name="Company A")
exec_b = Node("Person", name="Executive B")
graph.create(Relationship(exec_b, "AFFILIATED_WITH", company_a))

query = """
MATCH (p:Person)-[:AFFILIATED_WITH*..6]-(c:Company)
WHERE c.name = 'Company A'
RETURN p, c
"""
results = graph.run(query)
for record in results:
    print(record)
```

---

### **3. Insider Trade and Political Donation Monitoring** 💼
**Objective**: Monitor insider trades and cross-reference with political affiliations.
- Tracks trades via SEC filings.
- Links insider trading patterns with political donations using OpenSecrets.org.

**Example**:
```python
import requests

# Fetch Insider Trades
sec_url = "https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html"
params = {"CIK": "0000320193", "type": "4"}
response = requests.get(sec_url, params=params)
print(response.text)  # Parse for trades

# Fetch Political Contributions
contributions_url = "https://www.opensecrets.org/api/"
params = {"apikey": "your_api_key", "method": "candContrib", "cid": "N00007360"}
response = requests.get(contributions_url, params=params)
contributions = response.json()
print(contributions)
```

---

### **4. Enhanced Communication Framework** 📡
**Objective**: Improve agent interactions for scalability and reliability.
- **Kafka Messaging**: Event-driven message broadcasting.
- **gRPC APIs**: High-speed, reliable inter-agent communication.

**Example**:
```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer

# Producer
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
producer.send('trading-signals', b'New trade signal detected')

# Consumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer('trading-signals', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
for message in consumer:
    print(f"Received: {message.value.decode()}")
```

## **How It Works** ⚙️

### **1. Data Ingestion** 🌐
- Collects data from APIs (e.g., Polygon.io, Yahoo Finance) and real-time news streams.
- Stores data in queues or databases for efficient processing.

### **2. Multi-Agent Coordination** 🤖
- **Coordinator Agent** ensures agents work harmoniously.
- Agents communicate using Kafka or gRPC protocols.

### **3. Analysis and Execution** 🧠💵
- **Media Analysis Agent** flags sentiment and bias.
- **Pattern Recognition Agent** identifies market opportunities.
- **Execution Agent** places trades via broker APIs.

### **4. Risk Management** 🛡️
- Continuously evaluates trade risks based on market, sentiment, and insider trading data.
